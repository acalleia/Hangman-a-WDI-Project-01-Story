        <p class="stext">In a land on the brink of famine the king in a fit of madness has sentenced all of his subjects to HANG.
          As crazy as he may be, the king is not without mercy. To save their own life, each subject must guess
          the letters that make up a word that the mad king is thinking. He even gives them five tries to get it right!
          Very few have survived; will you?!
