        <p class="stext">In a land on the brink of famine the king in a fit of madness has sentenced all of his subjects to HANG.
          As crazy as he may have become, the king is not without mercy. To save their life each subject must guess
          the letters that make up a word the king is thinking of. He's even given them five tries to get it right.
          Very few have survived; will you?!
